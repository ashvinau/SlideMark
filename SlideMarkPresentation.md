#### Introduction
- SlideMark is a markdown-like parser and renderer for presentation slides.

- A dual-pane GUI editor allows the user to create a presentation slide deck using a version of markdown which includes functionality to demarcate slides and describe slide styling and layout.

- Initially this application will be offline and cross-platform, with the potential for a web app in the future.

#### Our Purpose
- This software aims to provide an alternative to traditional point-and-click presentation tools like Microsoft Powerpoint or LibreOffice Impress. 
- The idea is to reduce a slide to its component parts via HTML/CSS templates, then fill those components in with text and images formatted with markdown. 

- Ideally, a user would be able to prepare a slide deck by writing source in markdown rather than fiddling with handles and spinners in a UI.
