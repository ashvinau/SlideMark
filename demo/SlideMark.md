# SlideMark (header 1)
## Text Styling (header 2)
This paragraph is designed to test text styling. **Bold** can be invoked with **two asterisks** or __two underscores__.
We should now have *italics* invoked with *one asterisk* or *one underscore*.
Additionally, ~~strikethrough~~ is available, invoked with ~~two tildes~~.
We are adding a native markdown ||underline|| token, invoked with ||two pipes||.

There is also novel support for ;;superscript;; and ,,subscript,, invoked with ;;two semicolons;; and ,,two commas,, respectively.

This demonstrates `inline code`, invoked with `the backtick`.
